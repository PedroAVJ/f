# Framework preludes

Import the parts you use explicitly:

```bend
import Base
import F
import State
import V
```

F supplies component functions, Shape/Layout trees and function transitions.
State supplies component data, AI stream/request data and Dot session records.
V supplies release/deployment declarations and plan/check functions.

Names enter the importing file's scope. For example, `UI`, `layout`,
`Session.initial`, `StreamState.reduce`, `Release` and `plan` require no F/State/V
prefix. Constructors with different meanings stay under their type: use
`UI.Text`, `Geometry.Text` and `Command.Start`.
Private helpers in the copied source do not become bare bindings.

Direct `.bend` imports still work. Prelude bindings refer to those same canonical
types and functions, so mixing a prelude and an explicit leaf import preserves
identity. Imports are local to a file; a module does not re-export its prelude.
The loader selects the public bindings internally. There is no export syntax,
visibility keyword, extensionless module resolver or Browser prelude.

The component/primitive browser bridge emits HTML/CSS or Canvas commands from
Bend values. Browser IO covers events, bounded HTTP, file selection, image decoding
and upload. Application reducers, layouts and views remain Bend functions.
See `WEB.md` for Wasm, workers and WGSL support and fallback limits.

MIT licenses and provenance remain beside the copied near-bend implementation.
